# Improving-the-Performance-of-Union-Men-s-Lacrosse
Collaborated with a classmate in order to complete a statistical process analysis on the Union Men’s Lacrosse team using JMP Pro. Our goal was to improve the team’s performance (defined by the team’s goal differential) by identifying what statistics/factors were most important to their success. The findings of our analysis were presented to the coaches and implemented into the team’s future strategy. The files in this repository are a write-up/markdown type version of the analysis and a powerpoint presentation version.
