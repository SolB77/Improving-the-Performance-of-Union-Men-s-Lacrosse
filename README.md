# Improving-the-Performance-of-Union-Men-s-Lacrosse
Collaborated with a classmate in order to complete a statistical process analysis on the Union Men’s Lacrosse team using JMP Pro. Our goal was to improve the team’s performance (defined by the team’s goal differential) by identifying what statistics/factors were most important to their success. The findings of our analysis were presented to the coaches and implemented into the team’s future strategy. The files in this repository are "Statistics Final Project.pdf" a write-up/markdown type version of the analysis and "Stat Presentation.pdf", a powerpoint presentation version.
